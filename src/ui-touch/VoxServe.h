// VoxVoiceService._serve in jade-on-mesh/meshcore-open-tak
// (lib/vox/voice_service.dart) so both ends behave the same on air:
//
//   raw request    0x72 via raw data, sent along a direct route. Answered along
//                  the reverse of the request's own path when it carries one
//                  (known to work right now), else along our stored route to
//                  the requester, waiting up to 3 s for one.
//   VR3 DM         the text request a listener floods when it has no route. The
//                  flood makes both radios learn a route a few seconds later, so
//                  we wait up to 25 s for it, then answer as raw data.
//   channel        0x72 as GRP_DATA 0x5643 on the channel the clip was posted in;
//                  answered on that channel. The clip's author answers after
//                  0.15-0.4 s, so listeners' requests that come close together are
//                  answered in one burst, plus a relay's time for each hop the
//                  request came so its flood has cleared, paced by FloodPace.h
//                  (learnt from the requests after each answer); this radio
//                  doesn't stand in for other authors.
//
// A request for the whole clip is answered with its parity packets after the
// data (VoxFec.h), so a listener mends what that pass loses by itself. A
// zero-hop request (an empty reply path) reaches every radio in range: one
// that isn't the clip's author waits 1-3 s and leaves out packets it hears
// another node send meanwhile.
//
// Packets are paced so we never talk over our own repeaters, flooded ones by
// FloodPace.h (same formula as
// the app), salted (0x57) when the requester says it takes them, one request
// served at a time, a repeat of the same request inside 6 s is ignored, and a
// newer request from the same listener for the same clip replaces one in progress.
