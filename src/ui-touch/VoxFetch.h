// Fetches MeshCore Open TAK photos for this radio: the requester side of the
// app's pull transfer (lib/vox/voice_service.dart in meshcore-open-tak), so a
// wadamesh radio with no phone attached can download a photo it saw announced.
//
// A photo is announced with a VI1 envelope; nothing is sent until someone asks.
// Each attempt picks the cheapest way that can work, as the app does:
//   direct   binary fetch over raw data along our route to the sender, asking
//            it to reply along the reverse of that route (alternating with its
//            own route when a direct attempt gets nothing back);
//   dm       a VR3 text DM, flooded (our route is cleared first), whose ACK and
//            path exchange give both radios a route; the sender answers over
//            raw data;
//   channel  the binary request as GRP_DATA (0x5643) on the channel the photo
//            was posted in; the sender, or anyone holding the photo, floods
//            the packets back to every listener.
// Attempts escalate on timeouts sized from the radio's airtime, re-asking only
// for missing packets, up to 15 attempts or 3 in a row that bring nothing.
//
// Pure C++ against VoxFetchIo, so the state machine is host-tested
// (test/test_vox_fetch.cpp). Single-threaded: call everything from one loop.
